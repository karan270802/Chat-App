- **Server-side**: Manages rooms, broadcasts messages, and handles user sessions
- **Database**: Stores user data and chat history (MongoDB)

## üß™ Testing

Manual testing was performed for:

- Multiple users joining/leaving rooms
- Message delivery and sync
- Disconnection and reconnection scenarios

> Automated testing with Mocha/Chai coming soon.

1. Push code to GitHub
2. Connect repo to the platform
3. Set environment variables
4. Deploy and open live link

> Make sure to allow WebSockets on your hosting provider.
